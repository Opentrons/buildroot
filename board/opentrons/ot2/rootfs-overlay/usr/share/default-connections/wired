# wired default network. This configuration is meant to try a very few times for
# an IP address through dhcp and then stop autoretrying if it fails so the
# fallback can take over. This connection shouldn't be edited if you want to
# configure other things about the connection since it's in part for detecting
# the network layout; if you know what kind of network you want to connect to,
# just create a new connection with autoconnect-priority>=2. This file will be
# overwritten on boot.
