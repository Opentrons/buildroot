# linklocal fallback wired network configs.
# This configuration is meant to take over after dhcp fails and get a linklocal
# connection. This connection shouldn't be edited if you want to
# configure other things about the connection since it's in part for detecting
# the network layout; if you know what kind of network you want to connect to,
# just create a new connection with autoconnect-priority=2 (or higher). This
# file will be overwritten on boot.
